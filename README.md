# Personal Fantasy Football Charts

These are two interactives I made for my fantasy football league for fun



### Node-Link Graph

An interactive of all points scored in league history, with each node represnting players and teams, and each link showing that points that player has scored for that teams

Clicking on a node will grey out all unaffliated nodes, and show a circle showing link strength for all affiliated nodes

It will also create a table and graph underneath the main visualization

### Points Line Graph

A line graph showing points scored or wins by team for either each year or cumulatively
